## Overview of the project

"Trials Track," my backend capstone, utilizes React.js, Python with Django, SQL, NextUI, and Tailwind CSS. It grants administrators CRUD for global trial and location management, integrating external APIs for trial retrieval and Google Maps. Researchers access relevant data, ensuring integrity. With a modern interface, Trials Track optimizes healthcare management for streamlined oversight and research.
